COMP2065-IFR Exercise 03
(Predicate logic) (20)

    This exercise has 2 parts. 
    
    The first part is multiple choice and your task is to 
    translate english to predicate logic.
    
    In the 2nd part we play logic poker again :-) but this time for
    predicate logic.

-- part 1 (10)
namespace family

-- Given the following type, predicates and relations:

constant People : Type
constants Male Female : People → Prop
-- Male x means x is male
-- Female x means x is female
constant Parent : People → People → Prop
-- Parent x y means x is a parent of y
constant Married : People → People → Prop
-- Married x y means x is married to y

The following questions are all mutiple choice and there is 
exactly one correct answer. You get 2 points for each correct answer.

To answer, replace 'sorry' by the number of the correct definition (1-5).

DO NOT modify any of the provided definitions.

For example:

PART 2 (10 points)
We play the game of logic poker - but this time with predicate logic :-)

You have to classify each proposition as either
  a) provable intuitionistically (i.e. in plain lean)
  b) provable classically (using em : P ∨ ¬ P or raa : ¬¬ P → P).
  c) not provable classically.
and then you have to prove the propositions in a) and b) accordingly.

You will start with a score of 10 points, and then 1 point will be deducted
for each incorrect classification and 1 point will be deducted for each
incorrect proof. We stop deducting at zero, so you cannot earn negative points.
So, for instance, if you do every proof correctly but do not classify anything,
you will earn 0/10.

CLASSIFICATION: For each proposition, replace sorry with
  Intuition     if the proposition is provable intuitionistically (i.e. in plain lean)
  Classical     if the proposition is provable classically (using em : P ∨ ¬ P or raa : ¬¬ P → P)
  NotProvable   if the proposition is not provable classically

**Important**: Every classification should be one of these three, or sorry. 
DO NOT put anything else on the right-hand side or leave it totally blank.

PROOFS: 
  Then, prove the propositions you classified as 'Intuition' or 'Classical'. 
  For the 'Classical' ones, you may use em or raa, as discussed in lecture.
  For propositions classified as 'NotProvable' just keep "sorry," as the proof.

  You are only allowed to use the tactics introduced in the lecture
  (e.g. assume, exact, apply, constructor, cases, left, right, have,
  existsi, reflexivity, rewrite)

  Please only use the tactics in the way indicated in the lecture notes,
  otherwise we may deduct points.
